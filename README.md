# The Pig Dice Game

## Introduction

Welcome to one of the first Web Applications I've built! This folder contains 
my take on the classic Pig Dice Game that many people have played. I utilized 
HTML, CSS, & Javascript (ES5) for this project with my focus being functionality and basic User Interface design principles. This simple game was made by me so I can practice what I learned on real world projects & showcase my skills as an asipring developer/designer.

## The Pig Dice Game Rules:
- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds
- In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he whishes. Each result get added to his ROUND score
- BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game
